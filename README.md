## Getting Started

First, you need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
